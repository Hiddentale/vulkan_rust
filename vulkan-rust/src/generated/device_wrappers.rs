    ///A render pass describes the attachments, subpasses, and dependencies

    ///are bound later via a framebuffer.
    ///
    ///Key design points:
    ///
    ///- **`load_op` / `store_op`**: use `DONT_CARE` for attachments whose
    ///  prior contents are irrelevant (e.g. a transient depth buffer). This
    ///  lets tile-based GPUs skip loads/stores, which is significant on
    ///  mobile.
    ///- **`initial_layout` / `final_layout`**: Vulkan inserts implicit layout
    ///  transitions at render pass boundaries. Set these to match your actual
    ///  usage to avoid unnecessary transitions. `UNDEFINED` for `initial_layout`
    ///  is fine when `load_op` is `CLEAR` or `DONT_CARE`.
    ///- **Subpass dependencies**: the implicit external dependencies
    ///  (`VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL`) are often insufficient. Add explicit
    ///  dependencies when subsequent passes read the output.
    ///
    ///For dynamic rendering (Vulkan 1.3+), consider `cmd_begin_rendering`
    ///instead, which avoids the need for render pass and framebuffer objects.

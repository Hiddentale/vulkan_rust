# Usage Notes

Frees a device memory allocation. All buffers and images bound to
this memory must already be destroyed, freeing memory while objects
are still bound is undefined behaviour.

If the memory is currently mapped, it is implicitly unmapped before
being freed. You do not need to call `unmap_memory` first, although
doing so explicitly is a common defensive practice.

Vulkan has a per-device allocation limit
(`max_memory_allocation_count`, often 4096). Sub-allocating from
large blocks and freeing them as a group keeps you well within this
limit.
